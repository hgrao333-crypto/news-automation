# Opening Image Branding Fix

## 🚨 Issue
The opening title card currently says "AI NEWS: The Future of Intelligence" but your content is about general news (Parliament, Pollution, Airlines), not AI news. This creates a branding mismatch that confuses viewers.

## ✅ Solution

### Option 1: Replace the Opening Image File
Replace the file at `temp/opening/open.jpg` (or `open.png`) with a new image that matches your actual content:

**Suggested Branding Options:**
- "Daily Brief" - Simple, clear
- "India Update" - Geographic focus
- "The 60-Second Scoop" - Format-focused
- "Must-Know Today" - Matches your script
- "Quick News Update" - Descriptive
- "Daily News Brief" - Professional

### Option 2: Create a New Opening Image
Create a new opening image (1080x1920 pixels, vertical format) with:
- Your chosen channel name/branding
- Clean, professional design
- Matches your content (general news, not AI-specific)
- Consistent with your visual style

### Current File Location
- `temp/opening/open.jpg` (or `open.png`)
- Format: 1080x1920 pixels (vertical/portrait)
- Used at the start of every video

## 🎨 Design Recommendations

For a **middle-aged demographic** interested in **practical news**:
- Clean, professional design
- Clear, readable text
- Not too flashy or trendy
- Trustworthy appearance
- Simple color scheme

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Design or source a new opening image
2. Save it as `temp/opening/open.jpg` (or `open.png`)
3. The video generator will automatically use it
4. Test with a new video generation

**Note:** The opening image is a fixed file that's reused for all videos. Changing this file will update the branding for all future videos.
